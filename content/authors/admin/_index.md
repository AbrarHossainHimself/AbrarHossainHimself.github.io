I am a Graduate Research Assistant at The University of Toledo, pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPC/DC). My research centers on developing system software solutions to improve the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of distributed and HPC systems, leveraging techniques such as stochastic modeling, control, and optimization. Alongside my work at UToledo, I have contributed to HPC network infrastructure improvements at NCSA and community data solutions at NCAR. 

In the rare moments I’m not chasing performance metrics, I chase perfect albums and films. Browse my questionable taste on
