Hi, I’m **Abrar Hossain**, a **Graduate Research Assistant** at **The University of Toledo**, and a **Visitor Researcher** at the **National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)**. I am currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** with a focus on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Stochastic Modeling, Control, and Optimization**. My research involves developing innovative system software solutions to optimize HPC systems for **efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness**.

Previously, I have contributed to various research projects and published papers addressing real-world challenges in edge computing and resource-constrained environments. I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of **HPC applications** and enjoy solving complex computational problems using **Bayesian methods** and **machine learning techniques**.

Before joining the University of Toledo, I completed my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from Bangladesh.

### 👨‍💻 What I’m currently working on:
- **HPC Application Autotuning on Edge Devices**  
- **Optimization of Edge Computing Systems for Scientific Workflows**

### 💡 Areas of Expertise:
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**
- **Bayesian Optimization and Control**
- **Stochastic Modeling & Statistical Analysis**
- **Edge Computing & IoT**
